Sketch 3
For my class project I am really interested in making an RPG quest generator that pulls from traditional 
tabletop games, fantasy characters and genres, and generates quests based on a story based on the genre 
given and then follows the constraints of said story. To explore this idea, for my sketch this week I 
took a look at QuestGen {https://github.com/lemilonkh/questgen} , a project that is built upon tracery 
to generate random quest information. After looking through this project I can see that it will have 
the same constraints as the Tracery programming language ie: characters can come back from the dead. I
then searched through a second library that had a similar idea called Questify {https://github.com/deanljohnson/Questify}
which led me to a deleted paper from The Laboratory of Recreation Computing that was published in 2011. 
I was unable to find the 2011 paper but the quest structure was used again in 2015 for an EverQuest quest
generator which looks promising for what I want to do.

I am currently planning on reviewing the below papers.
1. https://ianparberry.com/techreports/LARC-2015-01.pdf
2. Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry,
   "A Prototype Quest Generator Based on a Structural Analysis of Quests from Four MMORPGs", Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Procedural Content Generation in Games, pp. 1-8, Bordeaux, France, 2011.
3. Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry, "A Server-Side Framework for the Execution of Procedurally Generated Quests in an MMORPG", Proceedings of the 16th Annual European Conference on Simulation and AI in Computer Games (GAMEON 2015), pp. 103-110, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Eurosis, December 2015.{https://ianparberry.com/pubs/DoranParberryQuests2015.pdf}

m extremely interested in how the Questify programming language was inspired by Doran and Parberryâ€™s 2011
paper "A Prototype Quest Generator Based on a Structural Analysis of Quests from Four MMORPGs" but I hope
to find the 2011 paper or use the 2015 paper as a stepping stone to create a quest generator for various 
situation in games. I am also extremely interested in the LitRPG genre so I will base the initial stats 
off of the general tropes of the genre rather than modern video game systems since the events are easier 
to track in the old school table top gaming RPG format for me.
