For my second sketch I chose to try out the retro game engine
pyxel from the tinytools list. I chose this engine because I love retro games and it looked
interesting. One of the gaps this library addresses is  accessibility in my opinion.
Retro games are hard to program in their original language and pyxel utilizes many built in
features as well as color tools that made it easy to select a color palette for the game.
This game has an easy to access sound library that includes retro game sounds which is awesome.
Despite being extremely simple to use and reminiscent of the turtle library in my opinion in terms
of language command structure, I think this would make a cool loading screen widget,


After reviewing this, I think it would be a great
project for new programmers to learn. In the future I 
would be interested in its compatibility with different
game ai interfaces which I will hopefully try out in a future
sketch.

Some cons of this project include the lack of documentation and unclear
features list. This tool is similar to libgdx except that libgdx has better documentation and 
is written in Java.
